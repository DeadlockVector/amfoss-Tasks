# Terminal Hunt

## Part1
-Firstly, for cloning the repo locally, I used ```git clone address```

-Created the new directory with ```mkdir solution```
  
-Used ```cd solution``` to navigate to solution
  
-Created part1.txt with ```touch part1.txt```

-Text file can be edited with ```cat > part1.txt```


## Part2
-Used ```cd 6``` to navigate to folder #6 and copied the file to solution
  
-Used ```mv 1.txt part2.txt``` to rename the file
  
-Used ```cd ..``` to circle back to TerminalHunt

## Part3
-```git log``` can be used to obtain the commit history wherein the clue for part 3 was hidden
  
-the file is 10/1.txt, copied the file to solution and renamed it to part3 using mv
  
-commited using ```git commit -a -m "commit message"```


## Part4  
- ```git checkout asia``` to switch the branch to asia to find the 4th part
  
- ```find . -name athens.txt``` to check if the file is there
  
- Circled back to main using ```git checkout main``` and then ```git merge asia``` to merge the two branches as instructed
  
- Copied the file to solution and renamed it using mv


## Final steps  
- Found the password and used ```cat > password.txt password``` to enter the password in password.txt
  
- Used rm to remove part1.txt, part2.txt, part3.txt and part4.txt
